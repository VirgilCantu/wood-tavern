        The idea behind Wood Tavern has always been simple. Open a place where
        everyone wants to be, because anyone is welcome. Where you can meet up
        with friends, grab a craft brew or a cocktail, and wait to see which
        character you bump into this time. And there’s always good music, so
        catch a picnic table with your friends on the patio. People don’t just
        come here to drink. They come to Wood to get comfortable.
